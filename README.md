## About This page

#### This is my active GitHub account, where a number of my projects are available publicly as part of my portfolio. I started this account as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, and many of the projects included here come from that course. Since completing the immersive, I have continued to maintain this page, using it to hold my personal projects to help showcase my skills. Feel free to check back every once and a while to see what progress I've made.
