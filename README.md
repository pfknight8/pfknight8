## About This page

#### This is my active GitHub account, where a number of my projects are available publicly as part of my portfolio. I started this account as part of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, and many of the projects included here come from that course. I intend to continue to maintain this page, filling it with any interesting projects that I may do to keep up my skills, or learn something new. Feel free to check back every once and a while to see what progress I've made.
